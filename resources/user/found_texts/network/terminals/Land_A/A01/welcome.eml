Hi again,

I’m sorry if I was a little odd at the meeting. I know you were nervous, but the truth is that so was I. This may be hard to believe, but you intimidate me! You're so young and you've already accomplished so much... if the situation wasn’t so grim, I might even be jealous. :)

There's also something I wanted to clarify. I realize that, nominally speaking, I'm head researcher here. But this is your project and everyone will respect that. And yes, I know, you’re not used to working like this… but as of today, you’re in charge.

No pressure. *g*

Let's do this,
Nadya
